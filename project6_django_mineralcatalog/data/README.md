# Data: minerals.json

## Analyzing the data (optional)
- with `python analyze.py` in the main directory the data can be analyzed
- this will output the
files `data_summary.txt` and `data_detail.txt`

## Findings
- The data does include 3 duplicates, since the names are not all distinct.
- Some minerals seem to have the same image file.
- Only the group seems
appropriate for a select field.
- All fields are character fields.
- Only the image caption needs to be a Textfield with a length of > 400.
- Some names have to be shortened for the list page
