# My year at Treehouse
I was enrolled in the **Python Treehouse Techdegree**. 

## About
Treehouse offers a 6-12 month long Python Tech program. The main seeling point of that program is that you build up a repository of work, that you may showcase to future employers. This work is essentially what I store in this repo.

## Full Stack of Webdevelopment
The projects cover the full stack of Webdevelopment in Python. We took these steps:
1. Pure Python projects (Projects 1-4)
2. Flask and Django Applications (Projects 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 12)
3. Flask and Django Apis coupled with an Angular or React Frontend (Projects 10, 11) 

## Projects in Detail
All projects have:
- a README file that comes with instructions on how to install and use them. 
- a requirements.txt file, that states what packages they need in their virtual environment

You can download the repo and try install one of the projects, according to its instructions and try it out. They are supposed to all work, even though I am not longer actively working on them. This is why gathered them in one repo all together now, since they are just examples, not active projects.

Below you find them listed with short descriptions.

## Pure Python Projects

### Project 1: Build a Soccer League
- about: We had to build a simple program that would compute a team rooster and produce assignment letters.
- technical: file-io, commandline-tool, list-comprehensions

### Project 2: Battleship Game
- technical: designing classes, commandline tool,
- about: implementing the well known battleship game on the command line



### [Project 3: Worklog filebased](https://github.com/sabinem/python_techdegree_project3_worklog)
Here I build a **dialog system on the command line from scratch**. This worklog was a file based searchable worklog system.

### [Project 4: Worklog with a database](https://github.com/sabinem/python_techdegree_project4_worklogdb)
We repeated the worklog from project 3 using a database this time and a simple **ORM: Peewee**

## Pure Flask Projects

### [Project 5: Learning Journal with Flask](https://github.com/sabinem/python_techdegree_project5_learning_journal)
Our first Project with **Flask** was a Learning Journal, that came with **tagging** and used **markddown**.

### [Project 6: Mineral Catalog with Django](https://github.com/sabinem/python_techdegree_project5_learning_journal)
This was a datadriven project with **Django**. We builded a searchable catalog for data that was given as a json file.

### [Project 7: Learning Journal with Flask](https://github.com/sabinem/python_techdegree_project5_learning_journal)
### [Project 8: Learning Journal with Flask](https://github.com/sabinem/python_techdegree_project5_learning_journal)
### [Project 9: Learning Journal with Flask](https://github.com/sabinem/python_techdegree_project5_learning_journal)
### [Project 10: Learning Journal with Flask](https://github.com/sabinem/python_techdegree_project5_learning_journal)
### [Project 11: Learning Journal with Flask](https://github.com/sabinem/python_techdegree_project5_learning_journal)
### [Project 12: Social Team Builder](https://github.com/sabinem/python_techdegree_project12_teambuilder)
In this project the **django user model was customized**, otherwise it used **django formsets**
