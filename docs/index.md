# My year at Treehouse
I was enrolled in the **Python Treehouse Techdegree**. 

## About
Treehouse offers a 6-12 month long Python Tech program. The main seeling point of that program is that you build up a repository of work, that you may showcase to future employers. This work is essentially what I store in this repo.

## Full Stack of Webdevelopment
The projects cover the full stack of Webdevelopment in Python. We took these steps:
1. Pure Python projects (Projects 1-4)
2. Flask and Django Applications (Projects 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 12)
3. Flask and Django Apis coupled with an Angular or React Frontend (Projects 10, 11) 

## Projects in Detail

## Pure Python

### Project 1: Build a Soccer League
- about: We had to build a simple program that would compute a team rooster and produce assignment letters.
- technical: file-io, commandline-tool

### [Project 2: Battleship Game](https://github.com/sabinem/project2_battleshipgame)
- class design
This was a nice exercise for **designing classes**. Battleships, players and board were all candidates for classes.

### [Project 3: Worklog filebased](https://github.com/sabinem/python_techdegree_project3_worklog)
Here I build a **dialog system on the command line from scratch**. This worklog was a file based searchable worklog system.

### [Project 4: Worklog with a database](https://github.com/sabinem/python_techdegree_project4_worklogdb)
We repeated the worklog from project 3 using a database this time and a simple **ORM: Peewee**

## Pure Flask Projects

### [Project 5: Learning Journal with Flask](https://github.com/sabinem/python_techdegree_project5_learning_journal)
Our first Project with **Flask** was a Learning Journal, that came with **tagging** and used **markddown**.

### [Project 6: Mineral Catalog with Django](https://github.com/sabinem/python_techdegree_project5_learning_journal)
This was a datadriven project with **Django**. We builded a searchable catalog for data that was given as a json file.

### [Project 7: Learning Journal with Flask](https://github.com/sabinem/python_techdegree_project5_learning_journal)
### [Project 8: Learning Journal with Flask](https://github.com/sabinem/python_techdegree_project5_learning_journal)
### [Project 9: Learning Journal with Flask](https://github.com/sabinem/python_techdegree_project5_learning_journal)
### [Project 10: Learning Journal with Flask](https://github.com/sabinem/python_techdegree_project5_learning_journal)
### [Project 11: Learning Journal with Flask](https://github.com/sabinem/python_techdegree_project5_learning_journal)
### [Project 12: Social Team Builder](https://github.com/sabinem/python_techdegree_project12_teambuilder)
In this project the **django user model was customized**, otherwise it used **django formsets**
