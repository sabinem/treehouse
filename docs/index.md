# My year at Treehouse
I was enrolled in the **Python Treehouse Techdegree**.

## About
Treehouse offers a 6-12 month long Python Tech program. The main seeling point of that program is that you build up a repository of work, that you may showcase to future employers. This work is essentially what I store in this repo.

## Full Stack of Webdevelopment: Projects
The practical projects, that were part of this program, cover the range of Full Stack of Webdevelopment in Python:
1. Pure Python projects (Projects 1-4)
2. Flask or Django Applications (Projects 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 12)
3. Flask or Django Apis coupled with an Angular or React Frontend (Projects 10, 11)

## Installing Projects
You can install and try all project in a virtual environment
- a README file that comes with instructions on how to install and use them.
- a requirements.txt file, that states what packages they need in their virtual environment

You can download the repo and try install one of the projects, according to its instructions and try it out. They are supposed to all work, even though I am not longer actively working on them. This is why gathered them in one repo all together now, since they are just examples, not active projects.

Below you find them listed with short descriptions.
