# Detailed Assignment

## Python Techdegree Treehouse Project 3

This project was an assignment of [Treehouse Techdegree Python](https://teamtreehouse.com/techdegree/python-web-development). Below you find the original description of the project.

## Description

In order to prepare better timesheets for your company, you've been asked to develop a terminal application for logging what work someone did on a certain day. The script should ask for a task name, how much time was spent on the task, and any general notes about the task. Record each of these items into a row of a CSV file along with a date.

Provide a way for a user to find all of the tasks that were done on a certain date or that match a search string (either as a regular expression or a plain text search). Print a report of this information to the screen, including the date, title of task, time spent, and general notes.

## Project Instructions

- As a user of the script, I should be able to choose whether to add a new entry or lookup previous entries.
- As a user of the script, if I choose to enter a new work log, I should be able to provide a task name, a number of minutes spent working on it, and any additional notes I want to record.
- As a user of the script, if I choose to find a previous entry, I should be presented with four options: find by date, time spent, find by exact search, find by pattern.
- As a user of the script, if finding by date, I should be presented with a list of dates with entries and be able to choose one to see entries from.
- As a user of the script, if finding by an exact string, I should be allowed to enter a string and then be presented with entries containing that string in the task name or notes.
- As a user of the script, if finding by a pattern, I should be allowed to enter a regular expression and then be presented with entries matching that pattern in their task name or notes.

## Extra Credit

- As a user of the script, I should be able to find entries within a range of time spent on a task.
- As a user of the script, I should be able to delete or edit entries.
- As a user of the script, I should be able to quit the script from the menu.
- As a user of the script, I should be able to navigate through the results of a search.
