# Detailed Assignment

## Python Techdegree Treehouse Project 4

This project was an assignment of [Treehouse Techdegree Python](https://teamtreehouse.com/techdegree/python-web-development). Below you find the original description of the project.

## Description

Create a command line application that will allow employees to enter their name, time worked, task worked on, and general notes about the task into a database. There should be a way to add a new entry, list all entries for a particular employee, and list all entries that match a date or search term. Print a report of this information to the screen, including the date, title of task, time spent, employee, and general notes.

## Project Instructions

- As a **user** of the script, I should be able to choose whether to add a new entry or lookup previous entries.
- As a **user** of the script, if I choose to enter a new work log, I should be able to provide my name, a task name, a number of minutes spent working on it, and any additional notes I want to record.
- As a **user** of the script, if I choose to find a previous entry, I should be presented with three options: find by employee, find by date, find by search term.
- As a **user** of the script, if finding by date, I should be presented with a list of dates with entries and be able to choose one to see entries from.
- As a **user** of the script, if finding by a search term, I should be allowed to enter a string and then be presented with entries containing that string in the task name or notes.
- As a **user** of the script, if finding by employee, I should be allowed to enter employee name and then be presented with entries with that employee as their creator.

- As a **fellow developer**, I should find at least 50% of the code covered by tests. I would use coverage.py to validate this amount of coverage.

## Extra Credit

- As a **user** of the script, the screen must be cleared for entering a new task and the menu is well formatted.
- As a **user** of the script, I should be able to find entries within a range of dates.
- As a **user** of the script, I should be able to be provided a list of possible matches if multiple employees share the same name.
- As a **user** of the script, I should be able to find entries within a range of time spent on a task.
- As a **user** of the script, I should be able to delete or edit entries.
- As a **user** of the script, I should be able to quit the script from the menu.
- As a **user** of the script, I should be able to navigate through the returned search results.
- As a **user** of the script, I should be able to find entries related to a specific project. This will require another field and/or model.
- As a **fellow developer** of the script, I should see test coverage of 85% of the code or better.
